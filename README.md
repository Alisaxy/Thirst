# Thirst
Thirst is a concatenative programming language that uses proper polish notation and is based on linked lists instead of stacks.

As of this moment the interpreter is being prototyped in Lua. It is planned to be rewritten in Rust once the core is ready.

##Finished:
* most of the core
* simple arithmetics a al Lisp
* loops
* quotes
* quote evaluator
* conditional fork

##Todo:
* proper recursion
* lists
* hash-maps
* string evaluator
* port to a proper systems language such as Rust
* make embeddable
* implement a bytecode VM
* write the all encompassing language reference and an extensive documentation
